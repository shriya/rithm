## Warm Up 

* [Quick Sort](https://repl.it/student/submissions/1135688)
* tricky; here is a quick sort solution: [quick sort exercise solution](https://github.com/rithmschool/javascript_computer_science_exercises/blob/solutions/sorting_algorithms_exercise/sorting.js)

## Meme Generator App

* We have JSON of all the memes with URLs, ids, title, height, and width
* we have to set the .env variables (IMG_FLIP_USERNAME, IMG_FLIP_PASSWORD, and SECRET_KEY) to our own account info for imgflip - never commit the .env because it's secret things (so put it in .gitignore) - people have scripts that go through github looking for API keys (like AWS - could cost you $$$!)

## Redux-Auth-Client-Server

* JWT is like a cookie but not stored as a cookie -- encoding and decoding into base 64 - [can do it ourselves here](https://jwt.io/)
* `Bearer ${token}`
* `jwtDecode` is an npm module that decodes the big token string
* `setCurrentUser` function has a `type: SET_CURRENT_USER` and a `user: user` -- redux knows the user is authenticated if this `user` objects exists, otherwise the authentication fails
* token was generated by our server (flask or node)
