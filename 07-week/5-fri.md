# Friday June 9

## Warm Up

* [Queues!](https://repl.it/student/submissions/1105297)

## Events in React

* Add event listeners as props on an element
* (button example is in free courses > react fundamentals > events > button)
* arrow functions have a lexical scope; binding of keyword this is same as this in scope of an arrow function - doesn't "reset" the value
* can bind this explicitly
* `e` is a [synthetic event](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/events.html)

## More ES2015 Weirdness

* to evaluate a variable as an object key, put it in `[]`
