# Weds May 24

## Warm Up

* [Capitalizations](https://repl.it/student/submissions/1035889)

## [Hashing, Cookies, and Sessions](https://github.com/rithmschool/python_curriculum/blob/master/Unit-02/03-hashing_cookies_sessions.md)

### Authentication & Authorization

* Authentication is who you are/aren't, Authorization is what you can/can't do
* Sign up & Log in - username & password 
* We do **not** want to hold our passwords in query strings (with a GET request)
* If passwords are just sitting in a database, anyone who sees that can get your password (and then try them on other accounts)
* We should hash them instead of storing them in plain text in the database
