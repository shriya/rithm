# Thursday April 27

## Warm Up
[Music Decoder](https://www.codewars.com/kata/a-simple-music-decoder)

* Parse number, range, or multiple

### Regular Expressions

* `(/\s*,\s*/)` remove spaces `\s` around the comma
* `(/^\-?\d+$/)` look for - or no - in front of any # of digits
* to match particular character in regular expression, need a backslash before the literal: `\*`
* then you have to put whole thing between `/ /` : so `/\*/`
* `"hello".match(/ll/)` => `["ll",2,"hello"]`
* `"t*m".match(/\*/)` => `["*",1,"t*m"]`
* `match` returns 
	* an array with `[matched segment, index it starts at, and original string]` if found
	* otherwise returns `null`
