## Warm Up

* Self Assessment 

- What's the difference between == and ===

== does type conversion; it will try to convert the item to the right of the equals sign to the same type as the item to the left to check a looser type of equality

=== does not convert between types and will check that the values *and* types are the same for both

- What is the keyword `this`?

'this' is a keyword that can refer to different scopes of a program based on where it is used; it's most commonly used inside of something like a constructor, class, or function to allow the programmer to refer to the containing object

- What are some ways of managing asynchronous code in JavaScript?

asynchronous code can be managed with promises 

- What is a closure?
- What do call, apply and bind do?

call, apply, and bind change the scope of the 'this' keyword while allowing the user to partially or fully run the function whose scope we want to change

- How do you implement inheritance in JavaScript?
- How does your data flow in React?
- What is a promise?
- What is the event loop?

the event loop is how tasks are executed in javascript asynchronously; when a program sees a function, it is put on the call stack, and only removed and moved to the queue once any timeout has run out

- What is the difference between state and props?

props are values passed into a component, like variables. state keeps track of snapshots in time for certain changeable quantities on a component.

- What is functional programming?

functional programming is a way to program such that for a particular input, the output of a function will always be the same. 

- What is event delegation?
- How do you implement prototypal inheritance in JavaScript?

you can add functions to the prototype with the 

ClassName.prototype.functionName = function() {
  
}

syntax

- What does "favor composition over inheritance" mean?
- What is a higher order component in React?
- What is asynchronous programming. Why is it important in JavaScript?
