# Tues July 18

## Warm Up

* Replit problems then Outco Interview :( 

## Algorithms & Data Structures

#### Arrays
* great for access
* not great for search or insertion

#### Stacks
* LIFO
* push & pop --> O(1)
* commonly implemented as list

#### Queues
* FIFO
* enqueue, dequeue --> O(1)
* commonly implemented as list

#### Lists
* doubly-linked list / deck / double-ended queue (pointer at both ends & can move in both directions)
* singly-linked list (pointer at start & can move in one direction)
* circularly linked list

#### Tree
* binary
* binary search
* red-black
* DFS (depth-first) & BFS (breadth-first) 

```
N = node, L = left, R = right:

Pre-order: NLR

uses:
 - Outputs an array that helps you create a replica tree if you populate it with the arrayâ€™s order


In-order: LNR

uses: 
- The orders the values in array are in order of smallest to largest


Post-order: LRN

uses: 
- Deleting a tree, you need to do it recursively and deletes/frees the children first before freeing the root
```

#### Hash Table

* Can write perfect hash function if you know the size of your table
* Otherwise may have collisions - can use chaining by making a linked list
