# Friday July 7

## Warm Up

```
You are given a set of Matryoshka dolls (a.k.a. Russian nesting dolls). These dolls have incrementally smaller sizes such that the smaller dolls fit nicely into the bigger ones. Upon checking your set of dolls, you find that a few of them are missing.  Find out how many are missing from your set.

Your doll set is provided in the form of an integer array where the integer value represents the size of the doll.  A set of dolls should contain each integer from the smallest to the largest.

You can assume both the smallest and largest doll in the set are included in the array. There are also no duplicate sizes in the doll set provided.

Time complexity constraint: O(N)
Space complexity constraint: O(1)

Input (Array): [4, 2, 6, 7]
Output (Integer): 2

Input (Array): [9, 12, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Output (Integer): 3 (edited)
 
Weâ€™d like you to write the tests
```

## Course Report

### Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)

* [AMP Project Main Site](https://www.ampproject.org/)
* [Moz Whiteboard Friday - AMP](https://moz.com/blog/accelerated-mobile-pages-whiteboard-friday)
* [Google's Official Mobile Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly)
* AMP is a lightweight version of a webpage that's stripped of many elements that normally cause a page to display slowly
* AMP pages do NOT get a ranking boost in mobile search results; google search results already have a mobile-friendly ranking boost and these are just part of that
* They do get a little AMP icon next to them
* [Google AMP Validator](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/guides/validate) -- [another one](https://validator.ampproject.org/)

## Outco 

* discuss cross-browser compatibility
* responsiveness working for x diff screen sizes
* track metrics of companies - # users & schools on CourseReport, # students at Tradecraft, etc
* write down manual job-tracking vs. streamlined system for tracking (Tradecraft) to calculate manhours saved
* notes for myself - to know what to discuss in interviews (but don't need to put on site)
* to display projects on portfolio site - click 1 screenshot and be led to multiple screenshots
